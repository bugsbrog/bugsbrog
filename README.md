# Hi there 👋, I'm Hannah

### Full Stack Web Developer

I am a music lover turned Full Stack Web Development student at Bloom Institute of Technology. My love for music started when I was very small. I remember starting piano lessons when I was in 3rd grade and my passion for music has grown since then. After learning all I could learn and achieving so much in music, I made the decision to finish piano lessons in May of 2021 and take a big leap into the Customer Service Industry.

My career goal is to work as a Front End Web Developer in a remote environment with a company that is right for me. If you take an opportunity to hire me, it will be worth it because I am a very driven person who works well in picking up new tasks and assignments.

Backend: Node.js, Express, SQL, PostgreSQL, GitHub, VS Code, Vercel, Heroku, Netlify
